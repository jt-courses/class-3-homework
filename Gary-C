I missed being victim of a terrorist attack in a subway by taking the early train. 5500 people were injured and 13 died.
I met Arnold Schwarzenegger and put my foot in my mouth by accidentally insulting his fitness. He just patted me on the stomach

I cruised a famous japanese mountain road in a Porche 911 Turbo. There was no drifting involved, just aggressive cornering.
